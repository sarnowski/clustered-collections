Clustered Collections
=============================================================================

The clustered-collections project aims to provide clusterable implementations
of the java collections framework. It has a small footprint due to a very
few dependencies.

It is not a replacement for caches! It lacks any eviction strategy nor does
it support persistence.


There are similar projects out there, e.g. KeptCollections(1). Target of this
project is to minimize dependencies and support a non-single-point-of-failure
architecture.
